# 09 Readme Generator
						
## Description
As a developer, I’m constantly creating new projects to sharpen my skills. Each project requires a README file. I’ve decided to develop an app that allows me to create README files by using just the command-line. This app was created using the inquirer package and will save me time in the future.
